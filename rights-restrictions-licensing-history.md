### Rights, restrictions, and licensing: History

An attempt to put the history of FOSS in the context of the broader sweep of 
history.

### through 15th century:

Moveable type printing press 

church and state monopoly served censorship

Stationer's Guild in UK had monopoly. Expired.

### through the 18th Century

[Statute of Anne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_Anne) was first copyright law. UK. 1710

#### US revolution, Constitution. 

[Article I, Section 8, clause 8]() gives Congress power to create copyright, patents.

A great many foundational ideas for computing were worked, out, just for
some examples by no means exhaustive:

[Boole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole)

[De Morgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws)

[Jacquard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacquard_loom), 

[Babbage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage), 

[Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace),

[Hollerith and the 1890 census](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Hollerith)

German mathematician [David Hilbert (1900)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_problems)
at the turn of the century set the stage for Church-Turing.

### Into the 20th century

Copyright grew to encompass new things: 

player piano rolls, sheet music, recorded sound, photographs, moving pictures

### 1930s

pre WWII 

[Church, Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Turing_thesis),
[Shannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon) et al, 

The roots of an explicit information theory and computer science were pretty
much laid down prior to WWII, with a long tail back into the history of
mathematics.

### 1940s

#### WWII:

Military need drove developments in cryptology, cryptography, cryptanalysis,
logistics, ballistics, eg, Manhattan project, Bletchley Park Bombe and
Colossus.

The Manhattan project was a notable user of services by people referred to
as [computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_computer#Wartime_computing_and_the_invention_of_electronic_computing). 

[ENIAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC)

### 1950s

post WWII 

[EDVAC & von Neumanns at IAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAS_machine), rise of electronic, stored-instruction, digital computing

printers and computers used to be people

AT&T monopoly, consent decree restricting it from computing business

### late 1960s

Multics --> Spacewar+PDB --> C+Unix --> Berkeley

### 1970s 

Honeywell vs. Sperry-Univac case breaks fundamental computing patents.

deregulatory spirit, eg

  * airlines
  * homebrewing

Forgot to mention 1970s birth (MITS ALTAIR, MS BASIC) and rise (IBM, Apple, TRS-80, TI-99/A, Timex/Sinclair, etc) of the personal computer using integrated circuit microprocessors.

### 1980s 

  * copyright comes to software, 
  * university tech transfer offices (Dole-Bayh Act) 
    * business formed from University efforts, NDAs
  * break-up of original AT&T: It could sell Unix licenses
  * IBM PC
  * Macintosh

Told story of Stallman and the printer jam alert system vs. the driver under NDA.

Companies cannibalized the MIT AI lab: Symbolics, Lisp Machines

Foundation of the GNU project, then the FSF, that takes us to 1985.

Goal was a complete, free OS.  One huge success was gcc (cf Tanenbaum and
the Free University Compiler Kit, Cygnus).  Made many applications and
utilities, never quite got their kernel, The Hurd, to work well enough fast
enough to be so widely adopted as other kernels.

At RIT: Checkout out the CAST building's **McGraw** displays (**MCI**); Wallace 2nd floor, printing presses.

Unix --> BSDs (Free, Open, Net, Dragonfly, MacOS via NeXT) (free and open
source before those terms were coined for software)

BSDi, 386BSD

Jolitzes, Bill Joy

Proprietary Unix versions: SunOS, Solaris, IRIX, AIX, HP-UX, Ultrix, Xenix

### 1990s

1991 Torvalds, U. Helsinki grad student, PC, MINIX & Tannenbaum, dial-up timeshare mainframe.

Puts it on Usenet (store-and-forward, "news", groups, subscribe, tracked what was read) and FTP (pre HTTP file transfer, see also gopher)

Linux kernel + GNU utilities --> a useful system

grew alongside the BSDs 

Tim Berners-Lee @ CERN, WWW, http, browsers

Marc Andreessen @ NCSA UIUC, Mosaic, \<img> tag

what is Mozilla short for?

Netscape

Microsoft IE and bundling

browser wars

antitrust suit

Sun, Oracle et al

StarOffice, OpenOffice, LibreOffice, The Document Foundation

Sonny Bono Copyright Extension Act

Rise of home dial-up

AOL

### 2000s

Afghanistan, Iraq, DHS, Room 641A

### 2010s

[rapid rise of smartphone use](https://www.goboomtown.com/media/Smartphone-Penetration-in-the-US.jpg)

Snowden revelations 2013

VW scandal 2015

social media use rises to near-ubiquity
