# Literature Review 2 Peterson & Hill


For the second graded literature review please read the following two 
pieces each of which discusses the differences between the terms **free software** and **open source software**.

The first is Christin Peterson's 
[How I coined the term 'open source'](https://opensource.com/article/18/2/coining-term-open-source-software)
([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20200204193449/https://opensource.com/article/18/2/coining-term-open-source-software))

The second is Benjamin Mako Hill's 
[When Free Software Isn't Better](https://mako.cc/writing/hill-when_free_software_isnt_better.html)
([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20190921141836/https://mako.cc/writing/hill-when_free_software_isnt_better.html))

You can discuss the articles separately, or try to relate them to each other 
(eg, to compare or contrast them), at your discretion.

Please make a blog post with the [litreview criteria](litreview) in mind.
