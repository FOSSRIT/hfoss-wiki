# HFOSS Final Project (all remote variant)

## Project introduction

We will be working together to port several activities for the Sugar 
Desktop, written in Python, to Sugarizer, using the sugarizer-lite 
repository. Each will choose from amongst a set of responsibilities for the 
overall process: Describing the **original projects**, describing **development examples** on the target platform, and integrating these two efforts into the 
**target activities**.

Students should familiarize themselves with Sugarizer activities or the 
musicblocks project, and be prepared to suggest up to three activities to 
use as examples. These will not necessarily address our curricular goals, 
but instead should serve provide an example of how a Sugarizer activity 
is put together, an example of what can be done and how it can be done.

Students should explore Sugar desktop activities available to port and that 
meet our curricular goals, and be prepared to suggest up to three activities 
in which they would most be interested in helping to port.
