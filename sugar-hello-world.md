We will try our hand at [building an Activity for the Sugar Desktop][10].

We will use the [sugar-live-build][15] virtual machines that we 
[installed earlier](install-sugar-live-build).

We will need to make sure git is installed. If not, in the Terminal
activity, we can install it via:

```sudo apt-get install git```

We will then navigate to the appropriate directory and clone the
[`hello-world` repository][20].

Then follow the instructions in [building an Activity for the Sugar Desktop][10].
