# Community Architecture group project, COVID variation:

**gbabv2** is now optional. If you have already run it, or manage to run it 
in time to draw something useful from it for the reports below, great. If 
not, no worries.

There will be no group presentation in any form.

Final deliverable will be an individual, not group, **report**, due via the 
usual **blog post** submitted via GitHub pull-request mechanism on 
**Wednesday March 25**.

Briefly **introduce** the project, describing the nature of the project. What is 
it? Is it a library or tooling, or is it targeted at end users? What 
platform or platforms does it target? What language or languages is it 
written in?


Then, **compare and contrast** your commarch project with your first (and 
possibly only) **bugfix project** on at least **three points**, drawn from, for 
instance, the coefficient-of-fail document, from gbab output, or from the 
following possibilities.

Make and push at least one journal entry about your commarch comparison 
before submitting your blog post. In it, briefly note the three points of 
comparison you're considering. If you can't decide and have other points 
you're considering writing about, this is an opportunity to let me know in 
an asynchronous way and then to get feedback.


Size/complexity of the project.
How much code.
How many developers.
How many users?

Maturity of the project.
How long has it been around?
What, if any, leadership transitions has it undergone?

Governance of the project.
Who decides what code gets in?
What license?
How are decisions made?
What planning is there?

Sustainability of the project.
Any paid contributors?
What resources are needed and how are they supplied?

Robustness of the project in the face of adversity, either demonstrated or 
anticipated.
