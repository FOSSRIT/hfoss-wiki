# Syllabus: The RIT Humanitarian Free/Open Source Software Development Course

## IGME-582 2195 Spring 2020 COVID-19 addendum 

So, as things have developed, I'm rethinking a lot of what I thought we 
might try to do. This is an update both to the syllabus and to my March 18 
emails.

### Class meetings 

Starting **Monday, March 23**, I will resume holding class meetings in IRC at 
**9am EDT/1300 UTC**. These will be logged as usual. Attendance is not strictly 
required, but this will be one of your options for your required 
**check-ins**. 

If we have a full agenda and good attendance, we might use all 
the time. If attendance is sparse and I've added what I think is necessary 
already into the meeting log, I'll maybe only hang around until, say, 
9:30am. If you'd like to attend but know you'll be late and would like to 
make sure I'm in channel past 9:30, please let me know by email or IRC at 
least 15 minutes before class starts.

### Journals

I will no longer be requiring the 4 journal entries per week rate, but we 
will continue the *option* of using the journal. I encourage you to continue 
using the journal because it remains a very flexible way to let me know not 
just what you are doing, but even *that* you are doing it. See **check-ins** 
below in which using the journal is one option.

### GitHub

Because a great deal of GitHub remains proprietary and centralized, I try 
not to rely heavily on many of its features and workflows that depend on 
those features and can't be used readily outside of GitHub.

That said, if I'm going to use a proprietary, centralized web service for 
renote collaboration, I'd pick the you-can-use-it-even-once-you-graduate 
GitHub any day over various of the heavily localized and 
restrictively-licensed learning management systems.

So, I'll be looking to immerse us further into the ways of GitHub to support 
our collaborative work on the final projects. Stay tuned.


### Check-ins

We need some way to stay in touch and to get feedback from each 
other in terms of how we're doing. I will look for at least as many 
**check-ins** from you as there would have been regularly scheduled class 
times. That is, in a full week of classes, at least 3 check-ins.

A **check-in** is one of the following: 

Attendance at a synchronous IRC meeting, 

a substantial journal entry about progress on your work and any questions or 
concerns, or 

an email either directly to me or to the floss-seminar mailing 
list with substantive commentary on your progress and with any questions or 
concerns. 

**Grading**: The journal and attendance points will be combined and distributed across these 
check-ins.

### Office hours

We'll be holding virtual FOSS Hours Thursday evenings from 5pm 
to 6pm (2100-2200 UTC) using videoconferencing. I may also hold 
videoconferencing office hours at other times, by arrangment. I expect we'll 
have enough bandwidth to do simultaneous voice and text chat, we'll have to 
see how well the video works with the constraints of everyone's bandwidth.
There will be no required videoconferencing or video production required by 
students. 


### Bugfix

Additional bugfixes accepted by upstreams continue to count as pure 
extra credit (eg, increasing the numerator "points earned" without also 
increasing the denominator "points possible").

### Meetups

Meetups are clearly not going to happen anymore. Meetup points will 
be removed from the default final grade tally. I will try to figure out how 
to include as additional assignments any meetups you've already done 
(you can still report meetups you've done, if you haven't already). If you 
have or will report meetups already done, points earned and total points 
possible will both go up. They aren't pure extra credit.

### Projects

We will complete the two remaining projects, but in modified form.  See 
[COVID-commarch](COVID-commarch) for the pending project. I will continue to 
work towards something for the [final](final) project, but plan to have 
further discussion and to gather further feedback about that once class 
begins again.
