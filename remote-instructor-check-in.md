## Instructor check-ins

Students are expected, at a minimum, to communicate the state of their work 
in the class through several [weekly check-ins](remote-student-check-in).

To complement that from the instructor's side of things, to accomodate the 
wide variety of times in which check-ins from various students with various 
schedules might arrive, and to help students know how soon, or how long, it 
might take for their check-ins to get seen and then, possibly, to get acted 
upon, I'm going to try to set a certain pace for myself.

For instructor check-in, I'm going to divide the day up as follows:

  * morning: 6am EDT to noon EDT (10:00 UTC to 16:00 UTC)

  * afternoon: noon EDT to 5pm EDT (16:00 UTC to 21:00 UTC)

  * evening: 5pm EDT to 10pm EDT (21:00 UTC to 01:00 UTC)

And will aim to spread my check-ins across the following schedule:

  * Sunday: 1 check-in, afternoon or evening
  * Monday and Wednesday: 2 check-ins, morning and then either afternoon or evening 
  * Tuesday and Thursday: 3 check-ins, one each morning, afternoon, and evening
  * Friday: 2 check-ins, morning and afternoon.
  * Saturday: 1 check-in, instructor's choice

I'll aim to document my check-ins through the instructor's journal 
[hfoss-2195](https://kgcoe-git.rit.edu/djaigm/hfoss-2195)

I'll be looking in IRC, watching incoming email, and pulling and merging 
from upstream student journal repositories. Replies will come via IRC or 
email, most likely. Replies to emails that come to me directly may turn into 
a message sent to the class as a whole via floss-seminar if my answer, for 
instance, clarifies a point relevant to everyone.
