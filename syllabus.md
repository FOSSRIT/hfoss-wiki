# Syllabus: The RIT Humanitarian Free/Open Source Software Development Course

## IGME-582 2195 Spring 2020 COVID-19 addendum 

So, as things have developed, I'm rethinking a lot of what I thought we 
might try to do. This is an update both to the syllabus and to my March 18 
emails.

### Class meetings 

Starting **Monday, March 23**, I will resume holding class meetings in IRC at 
**9am EDT/1300 UTC**. These will be logged as usual. Attendance is not strictly 
required, but this will be one of your options for your required 
**check-ins**. 

If we have a full agenda and good attendance, we might use all 
the time. If attendance is sparse and I've added what I think is necessary 
already into the meeting log, I'll maybe only hang around until, say, 
9:30am. If you'd like to attend but know you'll be late and would like to 
make sure I'm in channel past 9:30, please let me know by email or IRC at 
least 15 minutes before class starts.

### Journals

I will no longer be requiring the 4 journal entries per week rate, but we 
will continue the *option* of using the journal. I encourage you to continue 
using the journal because it remains a very flexible way to let me know not 
just what you are doing, but even *that* you are doing it. See **check-ins** 
below in which using the journal is one option.

### GitHub

Because a great deal of GitHub remains proprietary and centralized, I try 
not to rely heavily on many of its features and workflows that depend on 
those features and can't be used readily outside of GitHub.

That said, if I'm going to use a proprietary, centralized web service for 
renote collaboration, I'd pick the you-can-use-it-even-once-you-graduate 
GitHub any day over various of the heavily localized and 
restrictively-licensed learning management systems.

So, I'll be looking to immerse us further into the ways of GitHub to support 
our collaborative work on the final projects. Stay tuned.


### Check-ins

We need some way to stay in touch and to get feedback from each 
other in terms of how we're doing. I will look for at least as many 
**check-ins** from you as there would have been regularly scheduled class 
times. That is, in a full week of classes, at least 3 check-ins.

A **check-in** is one of the following: 

Attendance at a synchronous IRC meeting, 

a substantial journal entry about progress on your work and any questions or 
concerns, or 

an email either directly to me or to the floss-seminar mailing 
list with substantive commentary on your progress and with any questions or 
concerns. 

**Grading**: The journal and attendance points will be combined and distributed across these 
check-ins.

### Office hours

We'll be holding virtual FOSS Hours Thursday evenings from 5pm 
to 6pm (2100-2200 UTC) using videoconferencing. I may also hold 
videoconferencing office hours at other times, by arrangment. I expect we'll 
have enough bandwidth to do simultaneous voice and text chat, we'll have to 
see how well the video works with the constraints of everyone's bandwidth.
There will be no required videoconferencing or video production required by 
students. 


### Bugfix

Additional bugfixes accepted by upstreams continue to count as pure 
extra credit (eg, increasing the numerator "points earned" without also 
increasing the denominator "points possible").

### Meetups

Meetups are clearly not going to happen anymore. Meetup points will 
be removed from the default final grade tally. I will try to figure out how 
to include as additional assignments any meetups you've already done 
(you can still report meetups you've done, if you haven't already). If you 
have or will report meetups already done, points earned and total points 
possible will both go up. They aren't pure extra credit.

### Projects

We will complete the two remaining projects, but in modified form.  See 
[COVID-commarch](COVID-commarch) for the pending project. I will continue to 
work towards something for the [final](final) project, but plan to have 
further discussion and to gather further feedback about that once class 
begins again.

<a name="text-books"></a>

## Text Books

There are a number of textbooks we’ll be referencing throughout the
semester. They will be added to [the resources page](/oer)
or in the [library](https://github.com/ritjoe/hfoss-library) for your use.

Purchase of a textbook is not required.

<a name="what-you-ll-do"></a>

## What You’ll Do

This course will introduce students to the Free and Open Source Software
(FOSS) and Open Content movements, to the open source development
process, and to the open questions of the efficacy of technology in the
classroom.

Students will learn FOSS process and Tools with class projects that support
the [SugarLabs](https://www.sugarlabs.org) community (or other humanitarian projects) by creating
content and software for free distribution to students and teachers around
the world.  The SugarLabs project is driven by a world-wide community–one of
which successful students in HFOSS will become a part.


<a name="the-spirit-of-the-course"></a>

## The spirit of the course

While still a course where you will receive a letter grade, the spirit
of the course is intended to be both open and fun.

An open course – students will have access to the ‘document source’ for
the syllabus. As a student of the class you have a right to [fork the upstream repositories](http://github.com/ritjoe/hfoss)
for this syllabus and other course content ([library](https://github.com/ritjoe/hfoss-library), [wiki](https://github.com/ritjoe/hfoss/wiki)), make modifications, and
submit patches for review. Barring a troll festival, this can create a
fun, dynamic environment in which the course curriculum can develop by
the very same mechanism being taught during the semester
(community-driven).

<a name="licensing"></a>

## Licensing

All code developed by students in the course must be licensed (by the
student) under any one of the [licenses approved by the Open Source Initiative](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/category) 

Code that you write is **your** code, with which you can do what you
will; true. However, if you’re unwilling to license code you write for
an Free/Open Source course with a Free/Open Source license, you may be
in the wrong course.

Similarly, the essence of this course entails your doing significant
collaborative work in public, the results of which will remain public.
If you do not wish to make your work public in this way, please contact
the instructor during the first week of class to make other arrangements.

<a name="grading"></a>

## Grading

Please see [grading policies](https://github.com/ritjoe/hfoss/wiki/grading-policies) and this [example table of full-semester grades](https://github.com/ritjoe/hfoss/wiki/grading-table)


<a name="blog"></a>

## Blog Updates

Students are *required* to keep a blog to which they post updates about
their investigations, progress, success, and pitfalls. This blog can be
hosted anywhere, but must be added to the course [participant page](http://hfoss.rocfoss.org/participants) (there are instructions on how to do this in
[**First Flight**](https://github.com/ritjoe/hfoss/wiki/firstflight)). All blog posts are
syndicated to the blog aggregator [HFOSS Planet](https://people.rit.edu/djaigm/planet/hfoss/).

> You must make at least one blog post per week (up to 12) to receive full credit.
> You must participate regularly in the course’s IRC channel: asking and
> answering questions.
> Contributions to the course curriculum, syllabus, and rubric are
> factored in here as well.

Blogging is good for you and good for the [FLOSS community at large](http://xkcd.com/979/).

<a name="projects"></a>

## Team Projects

There are two team projects in the course: A community architecture
project and a final project.

<a name="xc"></a>

## Lightning Talks - Extra Credit

Every Friday for the first portion of class, any student has the
opportunity to give a `lightning talk` on a topic of their chosing. Your
lightning talk must be less than 5 minutes in length and must be at
least remotely related to the course material.

All students will do at least one lightning talk.  You will receive +10
extra credit points towards your final grade for every subsequent lightning
talk you give.  Only the first **2** lightning talks offered will be allowed
during a given class.  Talks will be chosen from among those offered by
students on a `FIFO` basis.


## Bug Fix - Extra Credit

You can earn extra credit by successfully fixing a bug in a FOSS
project.

You will receive extra credit points towards your final grade for
every pull request accepted by an independently-maintained project
against a pre-existing bug (eg, fixing new bugs you found, or even
generated don't count!).

Send an [email to the instructor](email:deejoe@mail.rit.edu) with
sufficient detail to confirm your bug fix was accepted.

<a name="accomodations"></a>

## Accomodations

RIT is committed to providing reasonable accommodations to students with
disabilities. If you would like to request accommodations such as
special seating or testing modifications due to a disability, please
contact the Disability Services Office. It is located in the Student
Alumni Union, Room 1150; the Web site is www.rit.edu/dso. After you
receive accommodation approval, it is imperative that you see me during
office hours so that we can work out whatever arrangement is necessary.
