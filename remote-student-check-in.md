### Check-ins

We need some way to stay in touch and to get feedback from each 
other in terms of how we're doing. I will look for at least as many 
**check-ins** from you as there would have been regularly scheduled class 
times. That is, in a full week of classes, at least 3 check-ins.

A **check-in** is one of the following: 

Attendance at a synchronous IRC meeting, 

a substantial journal entry about progress on your work and any question or 
concern that is blocking that work, or 

an email either directly to me or to the floss-seminar mailing 
list with substantive commentary on your progress and any question or 
concern that is blocking that progress.
