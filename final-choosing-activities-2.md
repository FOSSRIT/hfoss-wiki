# HFOSS Final Project (all remote variant)

## Further description, task types and interrelationships, and student task choices

### Further description

Our task over the last week has been identifying candidate projects to work
on, as per this [Final project introduction](final-intro-allremote-1).

Our goal is to settle on 6 projects total: 

  * Three existing Sugarizer activies to describe, then 
  * three existing math-related Python Sugar desktop activies
    * first to describe, 
    * then to port.

You will make four choices each combining a task with a project.

For each existing JavaScript project you choose, you will describe it.

For each existing Python project, you can choose *either* to describe it, or
to develop a JavaScript counterpart for it to run in Sugarizer, but *not*
both.

### Task types and interrelationships

The apices of this triangle represent the types of tasks. 

The sides of this triangle represent some of the ways to collaborate across
task types.
